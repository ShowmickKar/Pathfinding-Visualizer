# Pathfinding-Visualizer

Implemented Dijkstraâ€™s and A* Search Algorithm in Python to find the shortest route between two cells in a grid and visualized their workflow using a 2D graphics module called Pygame 

This project was heavily inspired by these two projects https://clementmihailescu.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/# and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtiK0DOeI4A&t=869s&ab_channel=TechWithTim
