# Pathfinding-Visualizer

* This project is made with python and pygame
* I have implemented the A* Search Algorithm to find the shortest path between two cells in a grid.
* This project is heavily inspired by these two projects https://clementmihailescu.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/# and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtiK0DOeI4A&t=869s&ab_channel=TechWithTim 
* I hope to add Dijkstra's algorithm and other features and in future.(Update: I have added Dijkstra's Algorithm!)
