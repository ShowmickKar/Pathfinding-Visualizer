# Pathfinding-Visualizer

* This project is made with python and pygame
* I have implented the A* Search Algorithm two find the shortest path between two cells in a grid
* This project is hevily inspired by these two projects https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msttfIHHkak&t=2859s and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtiK0DOeI4A&t=869s&ab_channel=TechWithTim 
* I hope to add Dijkstra's algorithm and other featers and in future.
